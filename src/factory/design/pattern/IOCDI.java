 * Inversion of Control and Dependency Injection is a core design pattern of Spring framework.

As name suggest Inversion of control pattern 
Inverts responsibility of managing life cycle of object 
e.g. creating object, setting there dependency etc 
from application to framework, which makes writing Java application even more easy. 

Programmer often confused between IOC and DI, well both words used interchangeably in Java world 
but Inversion of Control is more general concept and Dependency Injection is a concrete design pattern. 

Spring framework provides two implementation of IOC container 
in form of Application Context and BeanFactory which manages life-cycle of bean used by Java application
